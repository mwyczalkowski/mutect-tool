# Mutect CWL Tool

Simple CWL wrapper for [mutect-1.1.7](https://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/mutect) for use with TinDaisy.
Based on [OpenGenomics/mutect-tool](https://github.com/OpenGenomics/mutect-tool)

For development and testing purposes, this project ships with test data and demonstration
scripts for running directly (in docker container), by calling docker image, and by calling CWL tool.
See ./testing for details.
