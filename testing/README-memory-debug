Getting problems running manta sample data on katmai inside docker (direct call)
Running out of memory.

To debug, modifying image dinglab2/mutect-tool:latest with 
docker commit 
This introduces changes which will not be preserved upon docker build
Also making git memory-debug branch which will not be pushed to github

Partial solution to memory issues
* -xMx7g call to java mutect.jar fails because of out of memory issues when running manually inside of docker
* This has been replaced by a more general method
  * JAVA_OPTS environment variable is passed to the java call
  * Can call `export JAVA_OPTS="-xMx7g"` before executing `python mutext-tool.py` to reproduce default behavior
  * JAVA_OPTS also be set during `docker run` call

Were able to run WXS C3L-00004 test to completion from a rabix (CWL) call, with no JAVA_OPTS variables set.
The following was output, though its significance is not clear:
    picard.sam.CreateSequenceDictionary done. Elapsed time: 0.36 minutes.
    Runtime.totalMemory()=1386217472  [ 1.3Gb ]


Composer adds the following lines to CWL.  These are left here for reference but not tested
- class: ResourceRequirement
  ramMin: 8000
- class: InlineJavascriptRequirement
