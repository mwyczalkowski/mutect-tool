Jobs which die suddenly with "Killed" error output seem to be caused by running out of memory. 

There are three parameters to tweak in a cromwell run:
* Java parameter Xmx?g, seems to be maximum memory in g per job
* rammin - parameter passed to cromwell
* ncpu - number of jobs running at once

The hypothesis is that NCPU * Xmx <= RamMin, on the thinking that each thread requires Xmx and there will be NCPU of them,
so at least RamMin must be provided

Setting Xmx2g, rammin = 18, ncpu = 8 seems to be stable.
