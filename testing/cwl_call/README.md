CWL testing directories

* ./rabix is older testing of CWL under rabix
* ./cromwell-simple is based on simple cromwell MGI runs here:
    /gscuser/mwyczalk/projects/TinDaisy/TD-SW-compare/LSCC.202004/CromwellRunner-runs/mutect/mutect.C

Note that better developed scripts for testing both cromwell and rabix in MGI and compute environments exist in 
GermlineCaller project, e.g.,
    https://github.com/ding-lab/GATK_GermlineCaller
    /gscuser/mwyczalk/projects/GermlineCaller/GATK_GermlineCaller/testing/cwl_call
